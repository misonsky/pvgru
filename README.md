### PVGRU

The repository contains the code for PVGRUï¼Œthe baseline for comparison, and SepaCVAE, where the code for SepaCVAE is provided by the original author of the paper [1].



### Attention

We employ an improved version of BLEU and ROUGE  in paper [2]. When using the BLEU function provided by NLTK with SmoothingFunction().method7, the results are improved by about 20 points. We provide a set of comparative results for reference.
